In Python, it's important to write clean, readable, and consistent code. To style your if statements, you can follow these guidelines based on the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8), which is the official style guide for Python code:

Indentation: Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
python
Copy code
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
Line length: Keep each line of code within 79 characters.
python
Copy code
if long_variable_name > long_value and another_long_variable_name < another_value:
    # Your code here
Line breaks and binary operators: Break lines before binary operators for better readability.
python
Copy code
if (long_variable_name > long_value
        and another_long_variable_name < another_value):
    # Your code here
Whitespace around operators: Use a single space on both sides of binary operators.
python
Copy code
if x > 0 and y < 10:
    print("x is positive and y is less than 10")
Parentheses for clarity: Use parentheses to make complex expressions more readable.
python
Copy code
if (x > 0) and ((y < 10) or (z == 5)):
    print("Complex condition met")
Use one line for simple if statements, but not for complex ones.
python
Copy code
if x > 0: print("x is positive")  # Simple condition

# Complex condition
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
    print("Another line of code")
Use a consistent style for multiline conditions and always align the closing parenthesis with the first non-whitespace character of the previous line.
python
Copy code
if (x > 0 and y < 10
        and z != 5):
    print("Complex condition met")
By following these styling guidelines, your if statements will be more readable and maintainable, making it easier for you and others to understand and work with your code.
