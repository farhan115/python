program

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [5, 8, 12, 6, 9, 4, 7]

# Calculate the length of the list
length = len(numbers)

# Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
total = sum(numbers)

# Calculate the mean (average) of the numbers in the list
mean = total / length

# Calculate the maximum and minimum values in the list
maximum = max(numbers)
minimum = min(numbers)

# Print the results
print("Numbers:", numbers)
print("Length:", length)
print("Total:", total)
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Maximum:", maximum)
print("Minimum:", minimum)

output

Length: 7
Total: 51
Mean: 7.285714285714286
