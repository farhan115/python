code 

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Slice the list to get the first three elements
first_three = numbers[:3]

# Slice the list to get the last three elements
last_three = numbers[-3:]

# Slice the list to get every other element
every_other = numbers[::2]

# Print the sliced lists
print("First three: ", first_three)
print("Last three: ", last_three)
print("Every other: ", every_other)


output

First three:  [1, 2, 3]
Last three:  [7, 8, 9]
Every other:  [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
