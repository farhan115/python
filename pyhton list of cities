# Create a list of cities
cities = ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney']

# Use the append() function to add a city to the end of the list
cities.append('Rome')

# Use the insert() function to add a city to a specific position in the list
cities.insert(2, 'San Francisco')

# Use the remove() function to remove a city from the list
cities.remove('Paris')

# Use the pop() function to remove and return the last city in the list
last_city = cities.pop()

# Use the sort() function to sort the list in alphabetical order
cities.sort()

# Use the reverse() function to reverse the order of the list
cities.reverse()

# Use the len() function to get the length of the list
num_cities = len(cities)

# Use a for loop to print each city in the list
for city in cities:
    print(city)

# Print the last city that was removed using pop()
print(f"The last city removed was {last_city}.")

# Print the length of the list using len()
print(f"There are {num_cities} cities in the list.")
