program

# Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a list comprehension
squares = [num*num for num in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)

# Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 10 using a list comprehension with a condition
evens = [num for num in range(1, 11) if num%2 == 0]
print(evens)

# Create a list of odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a list comprehension with a condition
odds = [num for num in range(1, 11) if num%2 != 0]
print(odds)

# Create a list of tuples of numbers and their squares using a list comprehension with a tuple expression
pairs = [(num, num*num) for num in range(1, 6)]
print(pairs)

output

[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
